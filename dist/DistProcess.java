// TODO
// Replace XX with your group number.
// You may have to add other interfaces such as for threading, etc., as needed.
// This class will contain the logic for both your master process as well as the worker processes.
//  Make sure that the callbacks and watch do not conflict between your master's logic and worker's logic.
//		This is important as both the master and worker may need same kind of callbacks and could result
//			with the same callback functions.
//	For a simple implementation I have written all the code in a single class (including the callbacks).
//		You are free it break it apart into multiple classes, if that is your programming style or helps
//		you manage the code more modularly.
//	REMEMBER !! ZK client library is single thread - Watches & CallBacks should not be used for time consuming tasks.
//		Ideally, Watches & CallBacks should only be used to assign the "work" to a separate thread inside your program.
